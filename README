ABOUT
-----

The UC Berkeley Schedule Enhancer (UCBSE) is a User Script for 
Greasemonkey which improves the layout making it easier to read and 
search for classes.

INSTALLING
----------

The first thing you need is the Firefox web browser which can be 
downloaded at http://www.firefox.com/. After you have installed 
Firefox, the next thing you need is the Greasemonkey plugin which
can be downloaded at http://www.greasespot.net/. Next, you need to 
install our User Script. To install it, go to 
http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/105611 and click "Install". And
that's it! Now you can start using UCBSE!

REPORTING BUGS
--------------

If something looks funny or information is missing, please report it
so we can fix the bug as soon as possible! 

The best way to report bugs is to (1.) tell us the exact phrases you
entered into the search boxes, (2.) tell us the Course Control 
Number to give us a location of where the script went wrong, or (3.) 
send us a screenshot.

Please report all bugs here: http://userscripts.org/scripts/issues/105611
